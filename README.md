### About NU HCI
NU HCI is a group of graduate students, faculty, and post-doctoral researchers from a variety of disciplines. Group members research a wide array of topics in HCI, including Artificial Intelligence, User-Centered Design, Social Computing, and Learning and Collaboration Technology, and employ both qualitative and quantitative methods in their work. A graduate-student-run group, NU HCI organizes both social and academic events to foster cross-department community building and provides a venue for in-progress research feedback.

### About the colloquium
The HCI Student Research Colloquium series provides opportunities for PhD students to obtain in-progress feedback from a supportive, academically diverse audience. Sessions occur during specific weeks of the academic year during the Thursday 4pm timeslot. Each student presenter will share a ten-minute presentation followed by twenty minutes of interactive Q&A. A reception follows to allow for conversations to continue as desired.  

We plan to keep the [colloquium sign-up form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScps7EGLV9wH4JXmr4Dqbt3-JiZEX86nURSyBTuxbqDSVhN8g/viewform) open and accept new submissions on an ongoing basis. This is not a weekly commitment so the timing and format is flexible. Sessions may occur whenever students are interested and willing to present. Former presenters are welcome to present projects again after making more progress and/or present a different project.

Coming soon!
